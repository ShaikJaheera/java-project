The aim of the program is to print the following patter
         *

import java.util.*; 

Java util package contains collection framework, collection classes, on importing this package, we can access all these classes and methods.

public class Demo
{
  The Demo class is created.
  
int row, i, j, space = 1;  
row, i, j are declared as int datatype and sapce is intialized with 1

System.out.print("Enter the number of rows you want to print: ");  
to take input from the user (ie) the number rows the user want is taken by println

 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 
to takes the no of  rows from the user we have used scanner classes

 space = row - 1;  
 space taken should be less than row
 
for (i = 1; i<= space; i++)  
{ 
        System.out.print(" ");
}
this part of the code is used to check the spaces before and after the *, 

for (i = 1; i <= 2 * j - 1; i++)  
{  
        System.out.print("*");  
}  
this part of the code to print * pattren


for (j = 1; j<= row; j++)  
        {  
            for (i = 1; i<= space; i++)  
            {  
                System.out.print(" ");  
            }  
            space--;  
            for (i = 1; i <= 2 * j - 1; i++)  
            {  
                System.out.print("*");  
            }  
            System.out.println("");  
        }  
       
first j=1 if it is less than row size then it enters in to the space code 
it checks for space i is greater than space then loop exist and space will be reduced 
then to print the star pattern  i <= 2 * j - 1 itt checks the condition if it false then it comes out of loop


output:
enter no of rows:
3
then j=1, 1<=3 is true it enters into the space loop
i=1, 1<=1 
space is given
space--
then for star
i=1,i<2*1-1 that is i=1
1 star is printed 
        *

j is incremented then j=2, 2<=3 true
 i=2, 2<=2
 space is reduced 
 space--
 i=2,i<2*2-1 that is i=3
 3 stars are printed
        ***
  
j is incremented j=3, 3<=3 true
i=3, 3<=3
 space is reduced 
 space--
 i=3,i<2*3-1 that is i=5
 5 stars are printed
        *****
  j is incremented j=4, 4<=3 false exists out of loop and prints the output
                
                         *
                        ***
